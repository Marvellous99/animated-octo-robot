A blog designed with HTML, CSS and Node js with some other dependencies like multer where you can create, read, update and delete blog entries. It's my first backend project. 
The blog is my first backend project. Although the front end and designs are minimalistic, the blog performs the function that a standard blog would do. Users can create, read, update and delete. In addition to the standard blog, this blog also utilizes images on the front end; the images are saved and are displayed on the front end, the dependency that was used to achieve this was multer. While working on this project, I also realised that some HTTP methods like put and delete don't work with HTML, so the "Method-Override" was installed to use these methods. This will be the first of many projects as I embark on my journey.
